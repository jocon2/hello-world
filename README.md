Creating the Time Honored Tradition to Hello World!


Hello! My name is Jonathan Ocon.
I am a George Mason graduate that studied Computer Engineering, graduating in 2016.
I have experience in working with Java, Python, and C. I also have experience using VHDL.
At my time at Mason, I learned to create several different embedded systems, and how to combine them to create an interesting project.

I would love to find employment in a position where I can use what I learned at Mason.
